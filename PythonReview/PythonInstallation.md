# How to Setup Your Python Environment for Machine Learning

It can be difficult to install a Python machine learning environment on some devices. Python itself must be installed first and then there are many packages to be installed, and it can be confusing for beginners.

Here, I present how I setup my own Python machine learning IDE using Anaconda. You can follow the same to install and code in Python.

These instructions are suitable for Windows, MAC OS, and Linux platforms. I will demonstrate them on Windows, so you may see some Windows dialogs and file extensions.
