# How to Setup Your Python Environment for Machine Learning

It can be difficult to install a Python machine learning environment on some devices. Python itself must be installed first and then there are many packages to be installed, and it can be confusing for beginners.

Here, I present how I set up my own Python machine learning IDE using Anaconda. You can follow the same to install and code in Python.

I will demonstrate the installation instructions on Windows, so you may see some Windows dialogs and file extensions. However, these instructions may also be suitable for MAC OS and Linux platforms. 

# Overview
