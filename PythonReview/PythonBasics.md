# Python Review of Basics

Let's get started!

This review is for students who know some programming (as covered in COL106). Maybe you know another language (like C++ or Java), or you may be able to write a few lines of code in Python to something very simple. While writing this I have assumed that you know a few things, such as:

* You are familiar with basic Python,
* You are conversant with basic programming concepts, such as variables, arrays, loops, and functions
* You can work with Python using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  
This review is meant to help you transform from a novice programmer to someone who can code comfortably in Python. I will assume that you have a working Python 3.11 environment installed. If you need help with setting up the environment, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial here:
